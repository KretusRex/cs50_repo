Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Canada and Sweden having 20% chance to win if simulation was ran ten times.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems that predictions stabilizes after about 200000 simulations and increasing the number further does not result in a change of list later on.
