Good morning! I see you're working on Speller. It's a challenging problem set, but I'm sure you can handle it!

In your load function, you're trying to open a file based on command line arguments (argc and argv). However, these variables are not accessible in this function.
They are parameters of the main function, not load.

Instead, the load function receives the dictionary file name as a parameter (const char *dictionary).
You should use this parameter to open your dictionary file. Here's a simplified version:

FILE *input = fopen(dictionary, "r");
if (input == NULL)
{
    printf("Could not open file.\n");
    return false;
}
Remember, the goal of the load function is not just to open the file, but to read its contents into a data structure (like a hash table)
that you can use to quickly check if a word is in the dictionary. After opening the file, you'll need to read each word and add it to your data structure.
